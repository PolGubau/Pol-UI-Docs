# Button 

The button component is a common UI component found on the web that allows users to trigger certain actions on your website such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or downloading a file.

The examples from the Flowbite React library allows you to customise the buttons with different colors, sizes, icons, and more. All examples are built with React and Tailwind CSS.

In order to start using the button component you need to import it from Flowbite React:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'pol-ui';
```

## Default buttons

Use this example to create a default button by using the `<Button>` component from React and by adding the `color` property you can change the color of the button.

<CodeDemo data={root} />


## Outline buttons

Use the `outline` property to create an outline button with transparent background and colored border.

<CodeDemo data={outline} />

## Button sizes

You can update the size of the button by adding the `size` property to the `<Button>` component.

Choose from `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` as the value.

<CodeDemo data={sizes} />

## Buttons with icon

You can add icons to the buttons by adding it inside the `<Button>` component near the text.

 ## Button with loading state

Add a loading state to the button element by adding the `isProcessing` property to the `<Button>` component.

{/* <Example name="button.loading" /> */}

<br />
You can also customize the spinner icon by passing a React node to the `processingSpinner`
prop.

{/* <Example name="button.loadingSpinner" /> */}

## Disabled buttons

You can disable the button by adding the `disabled` property to the `<Button>` component.

{/* <Example name="button.disabled" /> */}

## Override Button base component

The `as` prop provides you the ability to transform the `<Button />` component into another component or HTML element. This prop accepts a string representing an HTML tag or a functional React component.

{/* <Example name="button.polymorph" /> */}

## Theme
