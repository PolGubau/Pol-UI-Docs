The **isClient** function is a utility that checks whether the code is running in a client-side environment (browser). It returns `true` if the `window` object is defined, indicating a client-side context, and `false` otherwise.

## Usage

Import the **isClient** function in your project and use it to conditionally execute code based on the runtime environment:

```tsx
import { isClient } from "pol-ui";

// Your code goes here

if (isClient()) {
  // Code that should only run on the client side
  console.log("Running on the client side");
} else {
  // Code that should run in other environments (server-side, etc.)
  console.log("Running in a non-client environment");
}
```

## **Return Value**

The function returns a boolean value (**true** or **false**), indicating whether the code is running in a client-side environment.

## **Example**

```tsx
import { isClient } from 'pol-ui';

if (isClient()) {
  console.log('Running on the client side');
} else {
  console.log('Running in a non-client environment');
}

// Output:
// Running on the client side
// or
// Running in a non-client environment

```

In this example, the **isClient** function is used to conditionally execute code based on whether the environment is client-side or not.

## **Use Cases**

1. **Conditional Code Execution**: Use **isClient** to run code specifically tailored for client-side environments, such as browser-specific logic.
2. **Next.js Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: In frameworks like Next.js, where server-side rendering is common, **isClient** helps identify client-side code to prevent server-side execution.

Integrate the **isClient** function into your project, especially in server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js, to handle environment-specific logic more effectively.
