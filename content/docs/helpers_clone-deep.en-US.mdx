The **cloneDeep** function is a utility that performs a deep clone of an object, creating a copy of the source object and all of its nested properties. This ensures that any changes made to the cloned object do not affect the original, and vice versa.

## Usage

Import the **cloneDeep** function in your project and use it to create a deep clone of an object:

```tsx
import { cloneDeep } from "pol-ui";

// Your code goes here

const originalObject = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
  address: {
    city: "Example City",
    country: "Example Country",
  },
};

const clonedObject = cloneDeep(originalObject);

// Make changes to the cloned object without affecting the original
clonedObject.age = 26;
clonedObject.address.city = "New City";

// Log the original and cloned objects to see the difference
console.log("Original Object:", originalObject);
console.log("Cloned Object:", clonedObject);
```

## **Parameters**

The **cloneDeep** function accepts a single parameter:

- **source** (**T**): The source object to be deep cloned.

## **Return Value**

The function returns a deep clone of the source object (**T**).

## **Example**

```tsx
tsxCopy code
import { cloneDeep } from 'pol-ui';

const originalObject = {
  name: 'Alice Wonderland',
  age: 30,
  preferences: {
    color: 'blue',
    theme: 'dark',
  },
};

const clonedObject = cloneDeep(originalObject);

console.log('Original Object:', originalObject);
console.log('Cloned Object:', clonedObject);

// Output:
// Original Object: { name: 'Alice Wonderland', age: 30, preferences: { color: 'blue', theme: 'dark' } }
// Cloned Object: { name: 'Alice Wonderland', age: 30, preferences: { color: 'blue', theme: 'dark' } }

```

In this example, the **cloneDeep** function is used to create a deep clone of an object. Modifying the cloned object does not impact the original, demonstrating the isolation achieved by the deep cloning process.

## **Use Cases**

1. **Immutable State in React**: When managing state in a React application, especially with nested structures, deep cloning can be useful to maintain immutability and prevent unintended side effects.
2. **Configuration Objects**: If your application uses configuration objects with nested properties, deep cloning ensures that modifications to one instance do not affect others.
3. **Data Transformation**: When transforming data structures during data processing or manipulation, a deep clone can be employed to create independent copies of the original data.

## **Pros and Cons**

<ProsCard
  title="Deep cloning is useful when"
  pros={[
    "Isolation: Deep cloning ensures that changes to the cloned object do not impact the original, providing a clear separation between the two instances.",
    "Immutability: Useful for scenarios where immutability is crucial, such as in React applications when managing state.",

<ConsCard
  title="Considerations for deep cloning"
  cons={[
    "Performance: Deep cloning can be computationally expensive, especially for large and deeply nested objects. Consider the performance implications in performance-sensitive applications.",
    "Circular References: Handling circular references in objects requires additional logic to prevent infinite recursion during the cloning process.",

Integrate the **cloneDeep** function into your project to facilitate the creation of deep clones, ensuring robust data handling and immutability where needed.
