## Introduction

The button component is a common UI component found on the web that allows users to trigger certain actions on your website such as submitting a form, navigating to a new page, or downloading a file.

The examples from the Flowbite React library allows you to customise the buttons with different colors, sizes, icons, and more. All examples are built with React and Tailwind CSS.

In order to start using the button component you need to import it from Flowbite React:

```jsx
import { Button } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default button

Use this example to create a default button by using the **{"<Button>"}** component from React and by adding the **color** property you can change the color of the button.

 <Example
 storybookUrl='http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/components-button--default-button'
  height={80}
name="Default banner"
code={root}
embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-button--default-button&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>
