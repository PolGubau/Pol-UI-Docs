# Getting Started

## Instalation

To install **pol-ui**, run the following command in your terminal:

### Install Tailwind CSS

To use the full potential of **pol-ui**, you should work with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

To install Tailwind CSS, we recommend following the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

These are the recommended ways as of January 2024:

### Configuring Tailwind CSS

Now we can configure our theme in the **theme** property.

#### Examples

Copy and paste this example to have a complete **tailwind.config.js** configuration.

Adding the route **./node_modules/pol-ui/src/\*\*/\*.js**, your Tailwind CSS styles will also affect **pol-ui** components.

Also remember to add the tailwindcss directives in a **globals.css** file in the root of your project.

```css
/* ./globals.css - Importamos este archivo desde nuestro layout principal*/
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Everything is ready!

Now pol-ui is completely customized and ready to be used in your application.

### Example of a button

```jsx {6-7}
import { Button } from "pol-ui";

function Home() {
  return <div class="flex gap-4 mt-4 items-center"></div>;
}
```
