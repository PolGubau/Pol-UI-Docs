## Introduction

The Gauge component can be used to show text, labels, and counters inside a small box or circle element which can be placed inside paragraphs, buttons, dropdowns, menu items, and more.

You can choose from multiple examples of Gauges based on the color, size, and icon and even use it as a link component by leveraging the properties from React and classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the Gauge component you need to import it from **pol-ui**:

```jsx
import { Gauge } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default Gauge

Here's a list of default **{"<Gauge>"}** component examples where you can use the **color** property to change the color of the Gauge based on contextual colors such as info, gray, success, and more.

<Example
  height={150}
name="Default Gauge"
code={root}
storybookUrl="Gauge--default-Gauge"
embedUrl="Gauge--default-Gauge&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>
