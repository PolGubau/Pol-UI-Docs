Card stacks are a fancy and modern way to display a collection of cards in a single view. They can be used to display a wide variety of content such as previews of blog posts, user profiles, pricing plans, and more.

You can use the **{"<CardStack>"}** component to display a collection of children with a draggable effect.
Feel free to use the **{"<Card>"}** component or any other component as children.

```jsx
import { CardStack } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default card stack

Use this example to show a simple card component with a title and description and apply the **href** tag to the **{"<Card>"}** component to set a hyperlink to the card.

<Example
  storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-cardstack--default"
  height={300}
  name="Default card stack"
  code={root}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-cardstack--default&viewMode=story"
>
  <RootCode />
</Example>

## Variants

### Just with one element

Just in case you just have one item to display, the component is ready to handle it. The element dragged won't be deleted and will be returned to it's position.

<Example
  storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-cardstack--just-one-element"
  height={300}
  name="Default card stack"
  code={oneItem}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-cardstack--just-one-element&viewMode=story"
>
  <OneItemCode />
</Example>

## Theme

interface CardTheme {
  root: {
    base: string;
    children: string;
    horizontal: IBoolean;
    href: string;
  };

  };
}
```
