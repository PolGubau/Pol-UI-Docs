## Introduction

In our UI, we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the foundation for our styles. If you're already familiar with it, using our UI will be straightforward.

If you're not familiar with Tailwind CSS, we recommend checking out its [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to understand how it works.

If you've set up your project following the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started), you can now use the default color classes.

```html title="Example of using default color classes" caption="Check that primary color is the one you set in your tailwind.config.js" showLineNumbers="true"
<span className="bg-primary text-secondary-50 p-4 rounded-xl">Hello world</span>
```

Result:

<span className="bg-primary text-secondary-50 p-4 rounded-xl">Hello world</span>

## Color Palette

Within **pol-ui**, we have **6 main colors**, each with a maximum of **10 shadows** that adapt to your project's styles using the **theme.extend.colors** property.

These colors are:

1. **primary**: The main color of the website.
2. **secondary**: Secondary color, used for backgrounds, non-important elements, shadows, etc.
3. **success**: Color for successful elements.
4. **warning**: Color for user warnings.
5. **error**: Color for elements with program consequences.
6. **info**: Color for highlighting user notices.

The examples in this documentation use the default colors, but you can change them in your **tailwind.config.js** file.

```js
  primary: '#B49CFF',
  secondary: '#BFBFBF',
  success: '#4CAF50',
  warning: '#FFC107',
  error: '#F44336',
  info: '#2196F3',
```

<ul className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-2">
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-primary text-center">
    Primary
  </li>
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-secondary text-center">
    Secondary
  </li>
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-success text-center">
    Success
  </li>
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-warning text-center">
    Warning
  </li>
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-error text-center">
    Error
  </li>
  <li className="flex w-full justify-center rounded-lg bg-info text-center">
    Info
  </li>
</ul>

You can extend your project's color palette without affecting **pol-ui** using the **theme.extend.colors** property. For example, adding a **purple** color:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // ... existing colors
        purple: "#B49CFF",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

Similarly, you can extend keyframes, animations, shadows, etc. Feel free to modify them as you prefer.

### Color Shadows

The UI configuration in Pol-ui is based on a main color and 10 shadows that adapt to that color.

The main color corresponds to shadow 500, and shadows range from 100 to 900.

To add a new color like **purple** in Pol-ui, you can do it this way:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // ... los colores que ya existen
        purple: {
          DEFAULT: "#8864FF",
          50: "#F5F3FF",
          100: "#EDE9FF",
          200: "#D4CFFF",
          300: "#BBA6FF",
          400: "#A27DFF",
          500: "#8864FF",
          600: "#6D4BFF",
          700: "#5532FF",
          800: "#3C19FF",
          900: "#2300FF",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Why do we use shadows?

We always use shadow 500 for the main color, and other shadows for elements as needed.

<Image
  src="/images/docs/ColorsExample.png"
  alt="Example of colors"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

In this Dropdown, the main color is **primary**, and shadows adapt to that color.
All **pol-ui** components use this configuration internally. You can use these colors in your own components or extend them as needed.

## Typography

**Pol-ui** is not opinionated about typography; it adapts to your project's choice.

### Local Typography

For vanilla or React projects with Vite, the recommended way to use a font is to use a local one. Add your font to your project and use it in your **globals.css**.

```css
@layer base {
  @font-face {
    font-family: "YourFont";
    src: url(./YourFont) format("woff2");
    font-weight: 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900;
    font-display: swap;
  }
  html {
    font-family: "YourFont", sans-serif;
  }
}
```

This configuration is for using this font with **Tailwind CSS**.

```css
@layer base {
  html {
    font-family: "YourFont", sans-serif;
  }
}
```

### Google Fonts Typography

Google Fonts provides a CDN link for easy use, but it's not recommended due to potential performance and privacy issues.

If you still want to use it, add the link to your **index.html** and use it in your **globals.css**.

### Google Fonts in Next.js

For Next.js projects, it's recommended to use Google Fonts as it downloads the font internally, not affecting your website's performance. Use the official [next-google-fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/font) package and follow their instructions.
