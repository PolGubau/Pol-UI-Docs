The avatar component can be used to show a visual representation of a user or team account for your application based on multiple examples, colors, sizes and shapes.

All of the example are built as React components and you can access custom props and methods to customize the component and you can also use Tailwind CSS classes to style the component.

To start using the avatar component you need to import it from the **pol-ui** package:

```jsx
import { Alert } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default alert

Here's a default example of the **{"<Avatar>"}** component where you can use the **img** prop to pass the image URL, the **alt** prop to pass a description of the image for accessibility and the **rounded** prop to make the avatar rounded.

<Example
  height={150}
name="Default alert"
code={root}
embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=size:md&id=components-avatar--default-avatar&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>

## Props

| Prop name | Type            | Default | Description                                        |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| icon      | React.ReactNode | null    | The icon to display in the accordion panel.        |
| onDismiss | () => void      | null    | Callback to be called when the alert is dismissed. |

## Examples

### OnDismiss

You can use the **onDismiss** prop to add a close button to the alert box and a callback to be called when the alert is dismissed.

Any function can be passed to the **onDismiss** prop and it will be called when the alert is dismissed.

<Example
  height={150}
name="Default alert"
code={root}
embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=size:md&id=components-avatar--default-avatar&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>

## Theme

### Additional types, AvatarStatusEnum

The **AvatarStatusEnum** is an enum that you can use to set the status of the avatar component. If you rather use a string, you can use the following values: **away**, **busy**, **offline** and **online**.

```js
export enum AvatarStatusEnum {
  away = 'away',
  busy = 'busy',
  offline = 'offline',
  online = 'online',
}

```
