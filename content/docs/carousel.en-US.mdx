Use the responsive carousel component to allow users to slide through multiple items and navigate between them using the control buttons and indicators.

Choose from multiple examples and options to update the intervals, make the carousel static and set custom control button and indicator by configuring React and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the carousel component you first need to import it from Pol-ui:

```jsx
import { Carousel } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default carousel
