## Introduction

The accordion component from Pol-ui can be used to toggle the visibility of the content of each accordion panel tab by expanding the collapsing the trigger
element based on multiple examples and styles.

The reactivity and state is handled by React and the components is built using the Tailwind CSS framework meaning that you can easily customize the styles and colors of the accordion.

To use the accordion component, you need to import the **{"<Accordion>"}** component from **pol-ui**:

```jsx
import { Accordion } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default accordion

Use this example of the {"<Accordion>"} component and the {"<Accordion.Panel>"} and {"<Accordion.Title>"} subcomponents to create an accordion with multiple panels.

<Example
  name="Default accordion"
  code={accordionRoot}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-accordion--default&viewMode=story"
    storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-accordion--default"

>

  <AccordionRoot />
</Example>

## Examples

### Always open

By default the accordion will close the other panels when a new panel is opened, but you can use the **alwaysOpen** prop to keep all panels open at the same time.

<Example
  name="Always open example"
  code={accordionAlwaysOpen}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-accordion--always-open&viewMode=story"
  storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-accordion--always-open"

>

  <AccordionAlwaysOpen />
</Example>

### Bordered

You can use the **bordered** prop to add a border to the accordion panels.

<Example
  name="Bordered example"
  code={accordionBorderedCode}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-accordion--bordered&viewMode=story"
    storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-accordion--bordered"

>

  <AccordionBordered />
</Example>

### Custom icon

You can use the **arrowIcon** prop to add a custom icon to the accordion panels.

<Example
  name="Always open example"
  code={accordionIconCode}
  embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-accordion--with-arrow-icon&viewMode=story"
  storybookUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-accordion--with-arrow-icon"

>

  <AccordionIcon />
</Example>
