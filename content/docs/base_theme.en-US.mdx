**Pol-ui** offers powerful theming capabilities that allow you to customize the look and feel of your application.

Let's have a loot at the different layers of customization:

## 1 - General configuration - Tailwind CSS

The main point to style **Pol-ui** is to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.
The file called **tailwind.config.js** is the main configuration file for Tailwind CSS. It allows you to customize the default theme, add new utilities, and more.

### Tailwind Plugin

To add facilities to the Tailwind CSS configuration, you can use the **tailwindcss** plugin that we provide inside of the package, there is no need to install anything else.

```javascript title="Example of a Pol-ui theme configuration"
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";
import typography from "@tailwindcss/typography";
import { poluiPlugin } from "pol-ui";

export default {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.tsx",
    "./node_modules/pol-ui/**/*.js",
  ],
  darkMode: ["class"],
  plugins: [typography, poluiPlugin({})],
} satisfies Config;
```

This plugin provides default color configuration for free, but you can customize it as you wish.

### Customize the plugin configuration

You can customize the plugin configuration by passing an object to the **poluiPlugin** function. This object has the following properties:

```ts
type CustomPluginConfig = {
  colors?: SomeColors;
  prefix?: string;
};
export type ColorScale = Partial<{
  50: string;
  100: string;
  200: string;
  300: string;
  400: string;
  500: string;
  600: string;
  700: string;
  800: string;
  900: string;
}>;

export type ThemeColors = {
  primary: ColorScale;
  secondary: ColorScale;
  success: ColorScale;
  warning: ColorScale;
  error: ColorScale;
  info: ColorScale;
};

export type SomeColors = Partial<ThemeColors>;
```

#### colors

You can provide any color you want to customize the default theme. The **SomeColors** type is a partial of the **ThemeColors** type, so you can provide only the colors you want to customize. There is no need then to provide all the colors.

#### prefix

You can provide a prefix to the colors that will be generated by the plugin. This is useful when you want to use the same color scale for different components.

### Example of a custom configuration

```javascript title="Example of a custom configuration"
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";
import typography from "@tailwindcss/typography";
import { poluiPlugin } from "pol-ui";

export default {
  content: [
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./content/**/*.mdx",
    "./node_modules/pol-ui/**/*.js",
  ],
  darkMode: ["class"],

  plugins: [
    typography,
    poluiPlugin({
      colors: {
        secondary: {
          500: "#FFD700",
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
} satisfies Config;
```

This configuration will override the default secondary color with a golden color, you can provide any shadow from any color.

#### Default colors

Inside of the plugin, you can customize our used colors:

- primary
- secondary
- success
- warning
- error
- info

### Adding more colors

In case you want to add more colors to the theme, you can use the **extend** property of the **theme** object in the **tailwind.config.js** file.

```javascript title="Example of adding more colors"
// tailwind.config.js
import { type Config } from "tailwindcss";

  export default {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "my-custom-color": "#FFD700",
      },
    },
  },
} satisfies Config;
```

This new color called **my-custom-color** will be available to use in your application, Pol-ui won't use it, but you can use it in the rest of your application as normal tailwind colors.

The good part of using the plugin is that for free you will have the colors [detailed before](#default-colors) without the need to add them manually.

## 2 - General configuration - Theming

In the root of you application, you can wrap your app with a component called **ProviderProps** , where a prop called **theme** is optionally sent. This prop is a object that has the same structure of the **Theme** type.

```tsx title="Props of theme object"
interface ThemeProps {
  mode?: ThemeMode;
  theme?: CustomPoluiTheme;
}
```

### Theme mode

You can specify the default light or mode for your application, the default value is **auto**. This means that the application will use the system preference to choose the mode.
You can send **light** or **dark** as well to force the mode.

### Theme object provided

The theme object is a quite interesting prop that allows you to modify each single tailwind class created in **Pol-ui** in your whole application.

```ts
export interface PoluiTheme {
  accordion: AccordionTheme;
  alert: AlertTheme;
  avatar: AvatarTheme;
  badge: BadgeTheme;
  popover: PopoverTheme;
  banner: BannerTheme;
  breadcrumb: BreadcrumbTheme;
  button: ButtonTheme;
  // ... and so on
}
```
Each single component has a prop called **theme** that is a structured object used to apply tailwind styles to the component.

If you for example, modify the global alert theme here, all your **alerts** will have this same changes. 

## 2 - Component customization

**Pol-ui** components are highly customizable. You can customize their styles by using the **className** prop, and you can also use the **styles** prop to provide inline styles.

### className prop

You can use the **className** prop to add your own classes to the component. This is useful when you want to override the default styles of a component.

```tsx title="Example of using the className prop"
import { Button } from "pol-ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return <Button className="bg-red-500 text-white">Click me</Button>;
}
```

### styles prop

You can use the **styles** prop to provide inline styles to the component. This is useful when you want to apply styles that are not possible to achieve with classes.

```tsx title="Example of using the styles prop"
import { Button } from "pol-ui";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button styles={{ color: "red", backgroundColor: "white" }}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## 3 - Global styles

You can also add global styles to your application. You can do this by using the **@apply** directive from Tailwind CSS.

```css title="Example of adding global styles"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.my-global-class {
  @apply bg-red-500 text-white;
}
```

## 4 - Dark mode

**Pol-ui** has built-in support for dark mode. You can enable it by setting the **darkMode** property in the **tailwind.config.js** file to **"class"**.

```javascript title="Example of enabling dark mode"
// tailwind.config.js
import { type Config } from "tailwindcss";

export default {
  darkMode: "class",
} satisfies Config;
```

You can then use the **dark** variant to apply styles for dark mode.

```css title="Example of using the dark variant"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.my-dark-class {
  @apply bg-gray-800 text-white;
}

.dark .my-dark-class {
  @apply bg-gray-300 text-black;
}
```
