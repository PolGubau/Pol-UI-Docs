The badge component can be used to show text, labels, and counters inside a small box or circle element which can be placed inside paragraphs, buttons, dropdowns, menu items, and more.

You can choose from multiple examples of badges based on the color, size, and icon and even use it as a link component by leveraging the properties from React and classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the badge component you need to import it from **pol-ui**:

```jsx
import { Badge } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default badge

Here's a list of default **{"<Badge>"}** component examples where you can use the **color** property to change the color of the badge based on contextual colors such as info, gray, success, and more.

<Example
  height={150}
name="Default badge"
code={root}
embedUrl="https://pol-ui-storybook.vercel.app/iframe.html?args=&id=components-badge--default-badge&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>
