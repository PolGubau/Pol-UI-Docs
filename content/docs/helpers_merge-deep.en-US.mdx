The **mergeDeep** function is a utility that merges and deep copies the values of all enumerable own properties from a source object to a target object, creating a new object with the merged and deeply copied properties. This ensures that changes made to the merged object do not affect the original target or source objects.

## Usage

Import the **mergeDeep** function in your project and use it to merge and deep copy properties from a source object to a target object:

```tsx
import { mergeDeep } from "./path-to-mergeDeep";

// Your code goes here

const targetObject = {
  name: "John Doe",
  address: {
    city: "Example City",
    country: "Example Country",
  },
};

const sourceObject = {
  address: {
    city: "New City",
  },
  age: 26,
};

const mergedObject = mergeDeep(targetObject, sourceObject);

// Make changes to the merged object without affecting the original target or source
mergedObject.age = 27;
mergedObject.address.city = "Another City";

// Log the original target, source, and merged objects to see the difference
console.log("Target Object:", targetObject);
console.log("Source Object:", sourceObject);
console.log("Merged Object:", mergedObject);
```

## Parameters

The **mergeDeep** function takes two parameters:

- **target** (**T**): The target object to get properties from.
- **source** (**S**): The source object from which to copy properties.

## Return Value

The function returns a new object that is a merged and deep copy of the target and source objects.

## Example

```tsx
import { mergeDeep } from "./path-to-mergeDeep";

const targetObject = {
  name: "Alice Wonderland",
  preferences: {
    color: "blue",
    theme: "dark",
  },
};

const sourceObject = {
  preferences: {
    theme: "light",
  },
  age: 30,
};

const mergedObject = mergeDeep(targetObject, sourceObject);

console.log("Target Object:", targetObject);
console.log("Source Object:", sourceObject);
console.log("Merged Object:", mergedObject);

// Output:
// Target Object: { name: 'Alice Wonderland', preferences: { color: 'blue', theme: 'dark' } }
// Source Object: { preferences: { theme: 'light' }, age: 30 }
// Merged Object: { name: 'Alice Wonderland', preferences: { color: 'blue', theme: 'light' }, age: 30 }
```

In this example, the **mergeDeep** function is used to create a new object by merging and deep copying properties from a target and source object. Changes to the merged object do not affect the original target or source objects.

## Use Cases

1. **State Management in React**: When managing state in a React application, especially with complex and nested structures, **mergeDeep** can be used to ensure immutability and prevent unintended side effects.
2. **Configuration Objects**: If your application uses configuration objects with nested properties, **mergeDeep** ensures that modifications to one instance do not affect others.
3. **Data Integration**: When integrating data from multiple sources or APIs, **mergeDeep** can be employed to combine and transform data structures while maintaining isolation.

## Pros and Cons

<ProsCard
  title="Benefits of mergeDeep"
  pros={[
    "Immutability: Ensures that the original target and source objects remain unchanged, promoting immutability.",
    "Nested Structures: Handles deeply nested structures, making it suitable for complex data scenarios.",
  ]}
/>
<ConsCard
  title="Considerations for mergeDeep"
  cons={[
    "Performance: Deep cloning can be computationally expensive, especially for large and deeply nested objects. Consider the performance implications in performance-sensitive applications.",
    "Circular References: Handling circular references in objects requires additional logic to prevent infinite recursion during the merging process.",
  ]}
/>

Integrate the **mergeDeep** function into your project to facilitate the merging and deep copying of objects, ensuring robust data handling and immutability where needed.
