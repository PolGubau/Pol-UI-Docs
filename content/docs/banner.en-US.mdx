## Introduction

A Banner is a important piece of UI for displaying **marketing**, informational, and call-to-action messages to website visitors. It provides a flexible and reusable way to present messages that can be fixed to the top or bottom of the page as the user scrolls through the main content area. The component enhances **user engagement** and communication by delivering important content in a visually prominent and persistent manner.

With the React Banner component from Pol-ui you can import a simple but powerful ready to use component that can be customized to match your brand identity with props as color, rounded sizes, and theme.

To start using the banner component you need to import it from **pol-ui**:

```jsx
import { Banner } from "pol-ui";
```

## Default Banner

If you don't need to customize the banner component, you can use it with the default settings. The default banner component has a background color of primary, a bordered prop setted to false and a rounded prop setted to "md".

<Example
  height={120}
name="Default banner"
code={root}
embedUrl="http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?args=&id=components-banner--default-banner&viewMode=story"

>

  <RootCode />
</Example>

## All colors

As a part of the Pol-UI library, the banner component supports all the colors from the design system to match your brand identity and provide a consistent user experience.

<Example
  height={480}
name="All colors"
code={Colors}
embedUrl="http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?args=&id=components-banner--all-colors&viewMode=story"

>

  <ColorsCode />
</Example>

## All colors in dark Mode

Dark mode is crucial for providing a comfortable user experience in low-light environments. The banner component supports all the colors from the design system also in dark mode:

<Example
  height={510}
name="All colors in dark Mode"
code={ColorsDark}
embedUrl="http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?args=&id=components-banner--all-colors-dark-mode&viewMode=story"

>

  <ColorsDarkCode />
</Example>

## All rounded sizes

As usual in the Pol-UI library, the banner component supports all the rounded sizes, they can be specified using the rounded prop or a Tailwind class as **rounded-xl** or **rounded-2xl**.

The following example shows all the rounded sizes available in the design system via the rounded prop:

<Example
  height={700}
name="All rounded sizes"
code={Rounded}
embedUrl="http://localhost:6006/iframe.html?args=&id=components-banner--all-rounded&viewMode=story"

>

  <RoundedCode />
</Example>
## Theme

```js
interface BannerTheme {
  base: string
  bordered: IBoolean
  color: ColorsType
  rounded: RoundedSizesTypes
}
```
