The navbar component is an important section of any website as it is the first section that appears on any page and it serves the purpose of allowing your users to navigate throughout your website.

Generally, the navigation bar consists of the logo of your website, a list of menu items for navigation and other secondary elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and a hamburger menu for mobile devices.

All interactivity and options are handled by using React properties and you can customise the appearance of the navbar using the classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the navbar component you need to import it from Pol-ui:

```jsx
import { Navbar } from "pol-ui";
```
