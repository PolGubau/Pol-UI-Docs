```jsx
import { Accordion } from "pol-ui";
import React from "react";

const AccordionComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Accordion alwaysOpen>
      <Accordion.Panel>
        <Accordion.Title>This is our most basic accordion</Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <p>
             This content is a div by default, but you can place inside any other component you like, for example, this <p> tag.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we use tailwind, you can style this accordion however you like.
            For example, you can add a border to the content.
          </p>
          <p className="border border-green-400 px-2 py-1 w-fit rounded-xl bg-green-200 mt-2">
            You see :)
          </p>
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Panel>
      <Accordion.Panel>
        <Accordion.Title as="h3">
          What if I don't like classes in my html
        </Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content
          theme={{
            base: "bg-red-200 border border-red-400 p-6",
          }}
        >
          <p>
            No problem, you can use the theme prop to style the accordion. You
            can also use the theme prop to override the default classes.
          </p>
          <p className="bg-blue-200 border border-blue-400 px-2 py-1 w-fit rounded-xl mt-2">
            This text is blue but the main content is red.
          </p>
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Panel>
      <Accordion.Panel>
        <Accordion.Title>What can I change by props</Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <h3 className="mb-4 text-lg first-letter:uppercase">
            The main props for the accordion are:
          </h3>
          <ol className="flex flex-col gap-2 divide-y w-fit">
            <li>
              <strong>alwaysOpen</strong> - if true, the accordion will always
              be open
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>bordered</strong> - if true, the accordion will have a
              border
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>arrowIcon</strong> - the icon to use for the arrow
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>collapseAll</strong> - if true, all panels will be closed
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>theme</strong> - the theme to use for the accordion as we
              did above
            </li>
          </ol>
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Panel>
    </Accordion>
  );
};

export default AccordionComponent;
